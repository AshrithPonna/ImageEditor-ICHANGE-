# ImageEditor-ICHANGE-
An efficient and effective program written in Java that can apply various image editing techniques to a particular set image that is saved as a '.jpg' file. Some constituents of the program include; Oriented Image Location, Grayscaling, Blurring, and Contrast Diversion. There are many more features in the works and many to arrive in the near future.

[Key Notes]: A main image requirement for this Java-oriented program is to include a '.jpg' file in order to validate the pixel altering process initiated in the progra. In addition, in order to apply certain effects to the image, the keyboard is involved, as key-type events are active when IChange is running. Here are the respective keys to type:

'd' - Image-Orientation (Horizontal).

'w' - Image-Orientation (Vertical).

'g' - GrayScaling Image.

'b' - Blurring Image

'c' - Deviating Contrast of Set Image.

'r' - Resetting Altered Image to Previous Version.

There, again, are more updates to arrive in the future, so enjoy editing.
